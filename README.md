Explanation on Licenses and Code of Conduct:
We chose to copy the License from <http://unlicense.org/> because it expressed free usage of the contained intellectual property.
The content in this particular repository is of near no concequence, so I have no issues with people doing what they want with it.
We chose to copy the code of conduct from Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
This is because it is a very well established and well thought throug code that seems to be well respected.
Thus, it is most likely much better than anything we could write in a timely manner.
