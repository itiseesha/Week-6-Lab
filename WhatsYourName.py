# For a more adavnced version of the code, maybe we can use the ASCII database, "American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding 
# standard for electronic communication." ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. 
# Then, using the ASCII database we can code using the database instead of the actual numbers we can use the binary coded chart and recognize characters in the code 
# with that method.
